Assignment 5 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)

This assignment went quite well for me. A few of the problems were difficult, but this is probably because pointers are quite new for me. However, I feel quite good about the assignment and feel like my ability to think about problems algorithmically is improving. 

2. What was hard about this assignment?

Pointers are quite new and so thinking in this new manner was difficult.
 
3. What would you like to know more about?

I would like to know more about why pointers are so useful. I have experienced why they are useful somewhat, but would like to know more. 

4. What resources (other than our book) did you use (e.g., website links)?

I used the TA and discussed the sort problem with a few classmates. 

5. What collaborators did you work with to discuss the problems?

I talked with the TA and Trista and Wenqi. 

6. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)

This assignment took me about 8-10 hours, including two TA sessions and working on the problems a few different times.
